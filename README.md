This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project for my test.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn install
```

Then you can run it with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can also visit [here](https://king-b.vercel.app) for the production instead.

## Re-using
I don't mind.
